# hello-world
Git setup. Maybe a dump for ideas. Probably nothing, though.

A little late to the GIT party, I'm currently working on getting my programming skills up to snuff so I can get a job doin d some real programming work. I'll probably put all of my old programming assignments here as well as a few projects I'm working on in my free time.
